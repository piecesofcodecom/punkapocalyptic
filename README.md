# Install 
Open your Foundry's admin dashboard and search for the system. I do not recommend manual installations, as Foundry supports direct installation. If you're a developer interested in contributing and need help configuring the system in your environment, feel free to open an issue.

# Support
This system is supported by [Tria Editora](https://triaeditora.com.br/), the publisher responsible for translating Punkapocalyptic into Portuguese and distributing it in Brazil.
